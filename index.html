<div class="content">
					<h5>Pros:</h5>
					<ol>
						<li> Students learn more effectively.</li>
						<li> Most professions use technology, so the more a child learns and uses it, the less intimidating it will be when they grow up.</li>
						<li> Technology gives students a freedom to work at their own pace. </li>
						<li> Students can increase engagement, save time,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   and develop future job skills. </li>
					</ol>

					<h5>Cons:</h5>
					<ol>
						<li> Students can easily get distracted with social media and games.</li>
						<li> Children get too much screen time and not enough face time so they don't learn how to interact with other people.</li>
						<li> When people solve problems on a computer, they use a different part of their brain than when they use only pencil and paper. If this skill is not learned appropriately, what would happen if they are expected to solve problems in the future with only their brains?</li>
						<li> Wi-Fi system needs to always align with the devices that are connecting to it.

<div class="content">
				<p>The Text to Change (TTC) project in Africa recently launched the Voice Africa's Future project, which aims to engage 150,000 young people across Africa by asking them to text what they think the future of their own countries should look like. In Ghana last year, a community of young people formed a netizens community and set up a hashtag on twitter (#GhanaDecides) to try and involve more young people and eligible voters to get involved in the general elections.

Yet the wholesale embracement of the idea of reaching young people through technology has also proved problematic.<br>


"In fact, despite all the big-name sponsors and tech-led education initiatives there have been rather disappointing results in efforts to integrate ICTs into education systems," says Kenny.

"There needs to be a massive training programme put in place alongside any kind of imported initiatives as you don't suddenly get a whole bunch of kids from slums in India applying for jobs at Microsoft and Google just because they've had one computer in the classroom."

The darker side of internet use and issues over privacy and safety of children and young people in developing countries is also a concern.<br>


Unicef's upcoming research into children and young people's use of ICT's exposes the lack of data and research on protecting children's safety online in developing countries compared to developed countries such as the UK or US.

Initial research findings reveal that up to a quarter of children in urban areas and one in every five children in rural areas surveyed in Vietnam had shared personal information such as their phone number or name of their school with someone online. In South Africa, more than 70% of users on an online social networking site talked to strangers at least once a week. In Vietnam 49% of urban children had been exposed to indecent content online, while 20% of rural children reported having been bullied, threatened or embarrassed online.

"Technology has the potential to be a huge force for good but it is not a silver bullet, a fix-all solution to how to fix the education and employment problems for young people in developing countries," says Kenny. "Yet one thing is clear â€“ it will undoubtedly play an increasingly important part of millions of young people's lives across the world."<br> To read more about this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/technology-empower-children-developing-countries"> click here</a></p>

				<h4> How Technology has Changed Education: </h4>
							<button class="collapsible">Open to learn more</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Technology has enhanced the way we learn in countless ways. Here are some different ways technology has changed education: <br>
<ol>>
<li>Communication Evolution
Because we text, our students have learned a dialect that we don't always understand. Kids communicate in many different modalities as a result of technology.  
<li>Expanding Audience
Students' sense of audience is completely different.  When I was in high school in the 1980s, the audience was the teacher.  When I started teaching high school in 1988, the audience was the teacher and peers.  In the 21st century, it's the WORLD.  Blogging, Twitter, Facebook, and other online platforms changed our notion of audience.
<li>Poster Boards: A Thing of the Past
Do you remember the history or science fair presentation boards that we created?  Web 2.0 tools like Glogster have changed this experience.  Glogster is a platform where students can create a multimedia "glog" or poster to demonstrate what they know and understand about a topic.
<li>Bye Bye to 3-Ring Binders
There's no need to carry around a bulky three binder anymore. A computer, tablet computer can keep all of those files and handouts in neat folders.  There's also a web 2.0 tool, LiveBinders that allows users to create a binder online.
<li>Interactive Textbooks
The way that we think of textbooks is completely changing. It is no longer limited to merely text and pictures. Today's textbooks often have web-based sites that include assessments, animations, additional materials, videos, and other materials to support the learning of new content.
<li>eBooks on the Rise
Speaking of textbooks, ebooks are becoming more prevalent in schools with the advancements of e-readers and tablet computers.  I think in the near future that students won't carry around big bulky backpacks filled with heavy textbooks.
<li>Disappearance of the Chalk Board
Much attention has been placed on interactive gaming as a powerful platform for student learning. Every day, new programs and web-based tools are teaching our students content that was once paper or chalkboard based.
<li>Assistive Tech for Better Communication
Voice recognition software has improved greatly in the past few years and is more accessible. Children with special needs and limited English proficiency are able to more effective communicate in language based contexts.
<li>The iPad: A Game Changer
iPads are such adaptable and powerful tools for teaching and learning.  There are so many applications but I think the most powerful and exciting aspect is the enhancement of learning experiences for students with special needs, particularly those on the autism spectrum.
<li>Extended Classroom Communities
Technology facilitates our ability to extend classroom community by using web-based platforms like Edmodo.  Teachers and students can use this platform to discuss homework, post assignments, and interact with peers as they work on projects.
<li>Rise of Web-Based Research
We still use libraries, but so much of our research and learning is now more web-based.  What used to take hours in the library to find, we find instantaneously.  As a result, we need to sort through huge amounts of information efficiently.  We know how to get and use information. I would argue that because it takes less time to find information, we spend more time digesting, thinking, and learning about new information.
<li>Meeting the Needs of All Learners
As educators, we know the power of Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences.  Technology facilitates our ability to meet the needs of all kinds of learners.
