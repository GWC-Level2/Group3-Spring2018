				<h4> Pros and Cons of technology in classrooms: </h4>
				<div>
					<h5>Pros:</h5>
					<ol>
						<li> Students learn more effectively.</li>
						<li> Most professions use technology, so the more a child learns and uses it, the less intimidating it will be when they grow up.</li>
						<li> Technology gives students a freedom to work at their own pace. </li>
						<li> Students can increase engagement, save time,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   and develop future job skills. </li>
					</ol>

					<h5>Cons:</h5>
					<ol>
						<li> Students can easily get distracted with social media and games.</li>
						<li> Children get too much screen time and not enough face time so they don't learn how to interact with other people.</li>
						<li> When people solve problems on a computer, they use a different part of their brain than when they use only pencil and paper. If this skill is not learned appropriately, what would happen if they are expected to solve problems in the future with only their brains? 
					</ol>
